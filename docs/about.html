                                Greetings viewers, my name is Michael Williams. I thought it was time to combine some of my favorite things,
                                so with a little of help of a jqeury library I threw this site up to post my art work :).
                                As you can see I am a huge fan of 'Rick and Morty', 'Gravity Falls', and cartoons in general. I am also a
                                mental health advocate, and feel mental health is an important topic in our life.
                                </p>
                                <h3>Why Share?</h3>
                                <p>It feels odd just placing my artwork out there where anyone could do anything with it without my knowledge.
                                    But when I critically thought about it. That is what every developer does when they create a pallette,
                                    a library, a framework, or anything else and put it up on any <strong>shareable service</strong> for everyone with a MIT, GPL v.2, or GPL v.3
                                among other licenses similar to these. So <em>I felt it was my turn</em>. Also, with that we face the chance of critism,
                                which (is changing for the better) when we share and upon receiving can turn us off from producing because were afraid
                                    to ask questions that hold us back from completing projects. Be bold, be strong, and be kind.
                                </p>      
                            </div>

                            <div class="card-title">

                            </div>

                                So, I am Mikey from sunny Florida. Learning web development, avid art maker, and music fiend/ guitar player.
                                I enjoy playing with problems and trying to figure out solutions. Love to draw from sketches of scenery, to
                                cartoons on tv. I like making music and playing with loops and drum beats when I am relaxing.<br>
                                    some of my future goals:
                            </p>

                                        <li>learn a framework</li>
                                        <li>Learn more about backend</li>

                                        <li>apply for a tech position</li>
                                        <li>Get better at drawing / learn how to use color pencils</li>
                                        <li>get better at my soft skills</li>
                                        <li>try to keep a good work / life balance</li>
                                    </ul>
                                <p>
